The primary purpose of the website is to provide a centralized online dashboard where people can access some information about enhancing public awareness, natural disaster, emergency hotlines and evacuation centers. Unlike social media posts, this  website is accurate and will ensure that all information is consistent and easily accessible from any device with internet connectivity.
